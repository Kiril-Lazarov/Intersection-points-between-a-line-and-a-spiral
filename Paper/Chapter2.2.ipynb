    "### <center> 2.2 Limitations of the Angle-Based Algorithm\n",
    "    \n",
    "In this section, we will examine all scenarios in which the algorithm fails and analyze the reasons behind these failures. Resolving the problematic situations will require modifications and expansions of the initial formula. Everything added to the formula from this point onward is aimed at correcting the errors. Once all errors in the algorithm have been addressed, we will proceed to derive the general formula for the intersection points between a spiral and a straight line of the type $y = ax + b$.\n",
    "    \n",
    "As we will see below, all limitations of the algorithm are tied to the position $x_l$ of the vertical line in relation to the specific configuration of the spiral's parameters - $v$, $\\omega$ and $k$. To ensure the algorithm functions correctly, it is essential to identify these situations through *algebraic checks* tailored to the parameters of the line and the spiral in each case. Some of these checks involve complex logic and require deriving advanced reduction functions. We will follow a strategy of deriving these checks algebraically outside the equation and then integrating them into it using their assigned names.\n",

The question here is how to interpret $x_s(t_{[n; m-1]})$? The *Probability Density Function* works with a random continuous variable. The variable $x_s(t_{[n; m-1]})$, on the other hand, is continuous but not random – it is the result of well-defined algebraic operations from the *angular algorithm*. Although the algorithm represents a strict sequence of algebraic actions, the parameters with which it operates – $v$, $\\omega$ and $k$ -  are chosen arbitrarily. In this sense, here we are looking for the *Probability Density Function* of three random continuous variables with respect to a fourth random continuous variable - $x_l$. And since there is no analytical connection between them, the probability of randomly selecting such values for the spiral parameters, so that after inputting them into the algorithm, we get another arbitrary value, tends to zero.\n",

Since the vertical line intersects the spiral at specific points, this circumstance requires all the individual sequences that make up the two-dimensional sequence to be convergent. From this perspective, we can redefine the goal of the problem as the task of constructing an absolutely convergent two-dimensional numerical sequence. We can define the absolutely convergent two-dimensional numerical sequence as follows:\n",
