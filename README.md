This project aims to present an attempt at an analytical solution to a mathematical problem for which no analytical solution exists. The problem is finding the intersection points between a straight line and an Archimedean spiral. The project consists of two main parts: one is the application for visualizing the line, the spiral, and the intersection points between them, which is located in the file "A song of Lines and Spirals.ipynb"; the other is the explanatory article, located in the Paper folder.

The application is a game simulation written with the Pygame 2.4.0 library. It is launched via the main() function. Drawing the spiral, the line, and various other functionalities are controlled by key combinations, which are detailed in the file key_combinations.txt.

The article, which provides the derivation and explanation of the method, consists of thirteen separate JupyterLab notebooks divided by topics. For greater clarity, the article includes images from the application and tables. These images and tables are visualized with code and are not available on GitHub.

The proposed solution to the intersection points problem is extremely complex. It requires knowledge of mathematics from the final years of high school and the first year of university-level mathematical analysis courses. Further developments on some of the topics covered in the main exposition are available in the appendix. These topics include the definition of a new class of parametric spirals, numerical sequences with arbitrary terms, and algorithms for finding sums and factorials of prime and composite numbers.

Enjoy :))
